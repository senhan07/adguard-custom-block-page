![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senhan07/adguard-custom-block-page/main/adguard%20home-preview.png)
This repository hosts a custom block page designed for AdGuard. The HTML code creates a visually appealing page displayed when content is filtered. It includes a header, a main section explaining the block, and a footer with links and information. The page dynamically fetches and displays the external IP address, current date and time, and the blocked URL. The design is responsive, featuring animations and personalized with AdGuard branding.
